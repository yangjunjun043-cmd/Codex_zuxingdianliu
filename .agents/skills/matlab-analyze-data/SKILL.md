# MATLAB Data Analysis

Generate idiomatic MATLAB code for tabular data analysis tasks using tables and timetables.

## When to Use

- Any task involving tabular data: exploring, cleaning, transforming, or aggregating tables
- Time-series analysis: resampling, synchronizing, trend detection, smoothing
- Answering questions about data in tables (top-N, filtering, group comparisons)
- Data cleaning: missing values, outliers, type conversion, normalization

## When NOT to Use

- The task has no tabular data context (no tables, timetables, or structured datasets)
- The primary goal is visualization or plotting, not data analysis
- The task is purely symbolic math, simulation, or app building

This skill covers core MATLAB functions for tabular and time-series workflows. These functions work natively with `table` and `timetable`, handle missing data correctly, and are performance-optimized. Prefer the modern functions recommended here (e.g., `groupsummary`, `datetime`, `fillmissing`) over legacy alternatives (e.g., `accumarray`, `nanmean`, `datenum`). Override only if the user explicitly requests otherwise.

**Before writing code, read the reference file linked at the end of the relevant section below.** Reference files contain correct syntax, common pitfalls, and "Avoid" patterns that prevent silent bugs. Skipping the reference risks using a deprecated approach or hitting a known pitfall.

### Key Functions — Available From

Most functions in this skill are available in R2023a or earlier. The following require a newer release:

| Function | Available From | Purpose |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `paddata`, `trimdata`, `resize` | R2023b | Pad, trim, or resize arrays to target length |
| `clip` | R2024a | Clamp values to a range |
| `summary` (enhanced) | R2024b | Supports arrays (numeric, datetime, duration, logical); adds `Statistics`, `DataVariables`, `Detail` name-value args |
| `isapprox` | R2024b | Tolerance-aware floating-point comparison (use instead of `==` for computed values) |
| `isbetween` (numeric) | R2024b | Check elements within a numeric range |
| `numunique` | R2025a | Count distinct values in a variable |
| `allbetween` | R2025a | Validate all values are within a range |
| `allunique` | R2025a | Validate all values are unique |

## Getting Oriented with Data

When data is already in a workspace variable, start by understanding its structure and contents. Use JSON output for reliable parsing — table display is designed for human-readable grids, but as text it is easy to misinterpret which values belong to which variables:

```matlab
jsonencode(summary(T))      % per-variable stats as nested struct
jsonencode(head(T))         % first 8 rows as structured JSON
```

**When getting oriented with unknown data, `summary(T)` already contains per-variable type, size, NumMissing, and — for numeric/datetime/duration — Min, Max, Mean, Median, Std. For categoricals it includes category names and counts.** This is usually sufficient for an initial overview.

If producing a standalone script, leave the semicolon off to invoke the `display` method — it shows dimensions, variable names, and a truncated preview. Avoid `disp` (omits headers and prints every row, flooding output on large tables) and `fprintf` in a loop (verbose, old-style):

```matlab
summary(T)                  % types, ranges, missing counts per variable
size(T)                     % [nRows, nVars]
sum(ismissing(T))           % missing count per variable
T                           % dimensions + header + truncated preview
```

**For Pearson correlation, use `corrcoef` (base MATLAB)** with `Rows="complete"` to handle NaN: `corrcoef(T{:,vartype("numeric")}, Rows="complete")`. For Kendall or Spearman rank correlation, use `corr` (requires Statistics Toolbox): `corr(X, Type="Spearman")`.

## Data Types

Use modern MATLAB types. These are faster, more readable, and work better with table functions.

| Instead of | Use | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `datenum`, `datestr` | `datetime` | Proper arithmetic, timezone support |
| `char`, `cellstr`, `strcmp` | `string`, `==`/`matches` | `==` for scalar, `matches` for vector comparison |
| Numeric codes or strings with few unique values | `categorical` | Self-documenting, works with grouping functions, memory-efficient |

```matlab
dt = datetime("2024-01-15",TimeZone="America/New_York");
names = ["Alice" "Bob"];           % not {'Alice', 'Bob'}
T.Status = categorical(T.Status);  % not numeric codes
```

Use ordinal categorical for ordered data like rankings or severity levels:
```matlab
T.Priority = categorical(T.Priority, ...
    ["Low" "Medium" "High" "Critical"], Ordinal=true);
urgent = T(T.Priority >= "High",:);
```

Extract datetime components for computed variables, filtering, or display:
```matlab
T.Month = month(T.Date);                   % numeric (1-12)
T.Weekday = weekday(T.Date);
T.MonthStart = dateshift(T.Date,"start","month");
```

String arrays support search, edit, and extraction:
```matlab
T.Domain = extractAfter(T.Email,"@");
T.Status = replace(T.Status,"N/A","Unknown");
T.Name = strip(T.Name);
```

Manage categorical levels with `mergecats`, `renamecats`, `removecats`, `reordercats`:
```matlab
T.Region = mergecats(T.Region,["Northeast" "Southeast"],"East");
T.Size = reordercats(T.Size,["Small" "Medium" "Large"]);
```

> Full examples and "avoid" patterns: [data-types.md](references/data-types.md)

## Tables and Timetables

Tables are the primary container for tabular data. Each table variable can be single-column or multi-column (e.g., a matrix); the only requirement is consistent row count. Use "variable" (not "column") to match MathWorks documentation. Prefer dot notation and named access over numeric indexing.

**Table orientation: each variable (column) holds values of the same type, units, and meaning; each row is one observation.** If data arrives transposed (measurements as rows, subjects as columns), restructure — don't store heterogeneous quantities (e.g., Height and Weight) in one variable, because grouping, filtering, and math operations all assume variables are homogeneous.

**It is rarely better to use a `for` loop to iterate over table variables.** MATLAB's table functions operate on multiple variables at once via `DataVariables` and `vartype` — prefer these over column-by-column loops.

```matlab
val = T.Value;                          % dot notation for a single variable
subset = T(:,["A" "B" "C"]);           % parentheses for table subsets
matrix = table2array(T(:,vartype("numeric")));   % extract as array
numericVars = T(:,vartype("numeric"));  % vartype for type-based selection
```

**Fix variable types after import** with `convertvars`:
```matlab
T = convertvars(T,["Region" "Status"],"categorical");
T = convertvars(T,vartype("cellstr"),"string");
```

**Use `timetable` when your data has timestamps.** If a table has a datetime variable representing when each row was observed, convert it to a timetable. This unlocks time-aware operations that would otherwise require manual date logic:

```matlab
TT = table2timetable(T,RowTimes="Timestamp");
% Now you can:
daily = retime(TT(:,vartype("numeric")),"daily","mean"); % resample (numeric vars only)
TT = retime(TT, unique(TT.Time), "firstvalue");  % resolve duplicate timestamps
TT2 = synchronize(TT_a,TT_b,"hourly");          % align two time series
TT_range = timerange("2024-01-01","2024-06-01");
subset = TT(TT_range,:);                        % filter by date range
TT_prev = lag(TT,1);                            % time-shift data
```

Another benefit of timetables: functions like `fillmissing`, `smoothdata`, and `isoutlier` automatically use row times for spacing-aware computation. With a plain table, you need to pass `SamplePoints="TimeVar"` explicitly to get the same behavior.

If working with legacy `timeseries` objects, consider converting with `timeseries2timetable(ts)` — the modern `timetable` is recommended.

**When you want to tag or annotate timetable rows with events, episodes, or phases** (sensor anomalies, storms, maintenance windows, warning periods), use `eventtable` to attach event information to the timetable — do NOT add boolean columns, string labels, or categorical state variables to the timetable itself. The eventtable system keeps event metadata separate from measured data, enables event-based filtering (`eventfilter`), tolerance matching (`withtol`), automatic event overlays in `stackedplot` (no manual `subplot`+`patch`/`xline` plumbing), and timetable display annotation, and avoids polluting the timetable with sparse columns that are mostly missing. To push events from an attached eventtable to the main timetable, use `syncevents`.

## Data Cleaning

### Missing values

Never compare with `==` for missing values (`NaN == NaN` is `false`). Use `ismissing` or `isnan`. For a quick boolean check, use `anymissing` — more readable and performant than `any(ismissing(...))`:
```matlab
anymissing(T.Value)                    % true/false: any missing values?
sum(ismissing(T))                      % missing count per variable (numeric vector)
summary(T, Statistics="nummissing")    % missing counts with variable labels (R2024b+)
```

**Standardize first, then fill.** Real data often uses sentinel values (`"N/A"`, `""`, `-999`, `0` where zero is meaningless) that MATLAB doesn't recognize as missing:
```matlab
T = standardizeMissing(T,{"N/A", "null", "", -999});   % convert to standard missing
sum(ismissing(T))                                        % now these show up
```

**Choose a fill method that matches your data.** Operate on the whole table with `DataVariables` to target specific columns rather than extracting individual columns:
```matlab
T = fillmissing(T,"constant","Unknown", DataVariables="Status");     % categorical default
T = fillmissing(T,"median", DataVariables=vartype("numeric"));       % column median
T = fillmissing(T,"linear", DataVariables="Temperature");            % smooth numeric
T = fillmissing(T,"previous", DataVariables="Setting");              % stepwise data
T = fillmissing(T,"movmedian",hours(2), ...                          % noisy, time-based
    DataVariables="Sensor", SamplePoints="Time");
```

For mixed-type tables, use `vartype` to apply different methods by type:
```matlab
T = fillmissing(T,"linear", DataVariables=vartype("numeric"));
T = fillmissing(T,"previous", DataVariables=vartype("categorical"));
```

Use `MaxGap` to avoid interpolating over long stretches of missing data. MaxGap is measured in sample-point units — for timetables, use a `duration` or `calendarDuration`:
```matlab
TT = fillmissing(TT,"linear", MaxGap=hours(24), DataVariables="Loss");
```

**Be cautious with `rmmissing` on an entire table** — it drops any row that has a missing value in *any* column, which can discard valid data unnecessarily. Prefer handling missingness per-variable with `fillmissing` or targeted column selection. Use `rmmissing` when you genuinely need complete cases across all columns.

### Outliers and range checking

Consider the data's domain expectations when choosing a detection method. The default (`"median"`) flags values more than 3 scaled MAD from the median:

```matlab
isOut = isoutlier(T,"quartiles", DataVariables="Value");     % IQR method
isOut = isoutlier(T,"mean", ThresholdFactor=2, DataVariables="Value"); % 2 std from mean
Tclean = rmoutliers(T, DataVariables="Value");               % remove outlier rows (default: median)
T = filloutliers(T,"linear","movmedian",5, DataVariables="Value"); % interpolate over local outliers
```

Detection methods: `"median"` (default), `"mean"`, `"quartiles"`, `"percentiles"`, `"grubbs"`, `"gesd"`, `"movmedian"`, `"movmean"`. **Use `ThresholdFactor` to control sensitivity** — it sets the number of scaled MADs (`"median"`), standard deviations (`"mean"`), or IQR multiplier (`"quartiles"`). Default is 3 for median/mean, 1.5 for quartiles.

**Use `OutputFormat="tabular"` when detecting across multiple variables.** Detection functions (`isoutlier`, `islocalmax`, `islocalmin`, `ischange`, `ismissing`) return a plain logical matrix by default on tables — variable names are lost. Pass `OutputFormat="tabular"` to get a table of logicals you can index by name: `isOut = isoutlier(T, OutputFormat="tabular", DataVariables=vars); T(isOut.Revenue, :)`.

**Range operations:** check, validate, or clamp values to a range:
```matlab
tf = isbetween(T.Age,18,65);                    % which rows are in range (R2024b+ for numeric)
allbetween(T.Age,0,120)                          % validate: all values plausible? (R2025a+)
T = clip(T,0,100, DataVariables="Score");        % clamp Score to [0, 100] (R2024a+)
```

### Aggregation statistics and missing values

Most aggregation functions (`mean`, `sum`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `median`) accept `"omitmissing"` to skip missing values. Prefer `"omitmissing"` over `"omitnan"` — it handles numeric data identically but also works with datetime, duration, string, and categorical types. Avoid legacy `nanmean`/`nanstd` (which require Statistics Toolbox).

```matlab
m = mean(T.Value,"omitmissing");
```

**Pitfall with `min`/`max`:** these take an optional second argument for comparison, so `max(x,"omitmissing")` tries to compare `x` with the string. Use the three-argument form:
```matlab
mx = max(x,[],"omitmissing");         % correct
mn = min(x,[],"omitmissing");         % correct
% max(x,"omitmissing")               % WRONG - errors
```

**Pitfall with `std`/`var`:** the first optional argument is a weight flag (0=sample, 1=population), not a dimension. To specify dimension, pass the weight first: `std(x,0,2)`. Writing `std(x,2)` does not compute std along dimension 2.

## Data Transformation

### Row filtering and sorting

**Prefer `isbetween` over manual `>=` & `<=` for range checks.** It handles boundary semantics (open/closed intervals), works consistently across numeric, datetime, and duration types, and is less error-prone than compound expressions:

```matlab
Thigh = T(T.Value > 100,:);                       % logical indexing (single bound)
TBob = T(T.Name == "Bob",:);                      % equality
Trange = T(isbetween(T.Age,18,65),:);             % range filtering (two bounds)
T = sortrows(T,"Date");                           % ascending by Date
T = sortrows(T,["Group" "Value"],["ascend" "descend"]);  % multi-key sort
top5 = topkrows(T,5,"Sales");                     % top 5 by Sales (descending)
```

### Binning

```matlab
edges = [0 18 35 50 Inf];
labels = ["Child" "Young Adult" "Adult" "Senior"];
T.AgeGroup = discretize(T.Age,edges,categorical(labels));
```

Note: if binning is for a subsequent `groupsummary`, `groupfilter`, `grouptransform`, or `pivot`, those functions support binning on the fly - no need to create a binned column first. See [Grouping and Aggregation](#grouping-and-aggregation).

### Normalization and scaling

```matlab
xnorm = normalize(x);                                       % z-score (default)
xnorm = normalize(x,"range");                               % scale to [0, 1]
xnorm = normalize(x,"norm",Inf);                            % divide by max (scales to [0,1] for positive data)
T = normalize(T,DataVariables=vartype("numeric"));           % all numeric variables
T = normalize(T,"zscore", DataVariables="Value");            % specific variable
```

### Type conversion and variable management

Check current types with `T.Properties.VariableTypes` (also writeable as a shortcut for conversion).

```matlab
T = convertvars(T,"Status","categorical");               % string to categorical
T = convertvars(T,vartype("cellstr"),"string");           % cellstr to string
T = renamevars(T,"OldName","NewName");
T = movevars(T,"Key", Before="Value");
T = addvars(T,x,y, Before="Value", NewVariableNames=["X" "Y"]);
T = removevars(T,["Temp1" "Temp2"]);
T = splitvars(T,"Coords", NewVariableNames=["X" "Y"]);    % split multicolumn variable
T = mergevars(T,["X" "Y"], NewVariableName="Coords");     % merge into multicolumn
```

### Adding computed variables

Prefer vectorized table arithmetic where possible. For iterative code where each row depends on the previous, extract variables into arrays, compute in a helper function, and assign back — do not index `T.Var(i)` inside a loop.

**Pass tables directly to math functions (`std`, `mean`, `sum`, `log10`, etc.) — do not extract with `T{:,:}` or `table2array` for operations that accept tables natively.** Use `std(T(:,vars))` not `std(T{:,:})`. Only extract to array for functions that require it (e.g., `eig`, `svd`, `corrcoef`).

```matlab
T.Total = T.A + T.B + T.C;                               % vectorized arithmetic
T.BMI = T.Weight ./ (T.Height / 100).^2;                  % element-wise ops
Tsum = sum(T(:,["A" "B" "C"]),2);                         % math functions work on tables: sum, mean, max, etc.
colStd = std(T(:,["A" "B" "C"]));                         % column-wise std — returns a table
T.Result = rowfun(@myFcn, T, ...                           % complicated row operations
    InputVariables=["A" "B" "C"], OutputFormat="uniform");
```

### Reshaping and aggregation

Choose based on whether you need aggregation, reshaping, or both:

- **`groupsummary`** - aggregate only (no reshape): multiple methods, multiple data variables. See [Grouping and Aggregation](#grouping-and-aggregation).
- **`unstack`** - reshape only (tall to wide, inverse of `stack`): spread one variable into many
- **`pivot`** - aggregate AND reshape (one row per X, one variable per Y): one data variable, one method, multiple grouping variables

```matlab
% Reshape without aggregation — use unstack
Twide = unstack(Ttall,"Value","Category");

% Aggregate and reshape — use pivot
P = pivot(T, Rows="Category", Columns="Region", DataVariable="Sales", Method="sum");
```

- **`stack`** - gather multiple variables into one (wide to tall):
  ```matlab
  Ttall = stack(T,["Q1" "Q2" "Q3" "Q4"], NewDataVariableName="Sales", IndexVariableName="Quarter");
  ```
- **`rows2vars`** - transpose a table (rows become variables)

### Joining

```matlab
T = innerjoin(T1,T2, Keys="Key");
T = outerjoin(T1,T2, Keys="Key", MergeKeys=true);
```

> `topkrows`, `varfun`, `splitvars`/`mergevars`, reshape examples: [data-transformation.md](references/data-transformation.md)
## Grouping and Aggregation

**`groupsummary`** is the go-to for grouped statistics. Do not use `findgroups`+`accumarray` or manual loops for aggregation — `groupsummary` is faster and works directly with tables. Use `findgroups` alone only when you need group indices without aggregation.

```matlab
G = groupsummary(T,"Category",["mean" "std"],"Value");        % multiple methods on one variable
G = groupsummary(T,["Category" "Region"],"mean","Value");     % multiple grouping vars
```

Notes:
- Output always includes `GroupCount` - no need to specify a count method separately. For counts only, use `groupcounts`.
- Valid method names: `"mean"`, `"sum"`, `"std"`, `"min"`, `"max"`, `"median"`, `"mode"`, `"var"`, `"range"`, `"nummissing"`, `"numunique"`, `"nnz"`, `"all"`. Do **not** use `"numel"` or `"counts"` (these will error).
- **Prefer string method names over function handles** (e.g., `"mean"` not `@mean`). Named methods use accelerated code paths and are significantly faster on large datasets.
- Consider `IncludeMissingGroups=false` to exclude groups defined by a missing value (such as `NaN` for numeric types) that can dominate results.
- Use `IncludeEmptyGroups=true` to include all categories of a categorical variable, even those with no rows.
- Supports on-the-fly binning: `groupsummary(T,"Age",[0 18 35 50 Inf],"mean","Income")` - no need for `discretize` first. Works with `groupcounts`, `groupfilter`, and `grouptransform` too.
- **Time binning has two forms — choose carefully.** Sequential (`"hour"`, `"month"`, `"year"`) creates one bin per calendar period in the data (e.g., Jan 2023, Feb 2023, ...). Cyclic (`"hourofday"`, `"dayofweek"`, `"monthofyear"`) collapses across the higher unit to reveal repeating patterns (e.g., all Mondays together). **For example, use `"monthofyear"` (cyclic) for seasonal patterns; use `"month"` (sequential) for a timeline.** No need to extract components with `hour()`/`month()` first — pass the binning rule directly to `groupsummary`.
- **Multiple binning methods:** use a cell array when types are mixed (e.g., a named method and custom edges), or a string array when all are named methods:
  ```matlab
  G = groupsummary(TT,["Time" "Time"],["year" "month"],"mean","Value");   % all named — string array
  G = groupsummary(T,["Region" "Age"],{"none" [0 18 35 50 Inf]},"mean","Income");  % mixed — cell array
  ```
  Variable name inputs (grouping variables, data variables) must be string arrays — not cell arrays. See [Use variable names not numeric indices](references/tables-and-timetables.md) for the general rule.

**`groupfilter`** filters rows based on group properties. Two use cases:

```matlab
% (a) Keep entire groups meeting a condition (e.g., groups with enough data)
T = groupfilter(T,"Category",@(x) numel(x) >= 10);

% (b) Filter individual rows within each group (e.g., per-group outlier removal)
T = groupfilter(T,"Category",@(x) ~isoutlier(x),"Value");
```

**When the filter logic matches a built-in detection function (`isoutlier`, `ismissing`, `ischange`), use it inside the function handle rather than reimplementing the arithmetic.** Built-in functions handle edge cases (NaN, constant groups) and accept tuning parameters like `ThresholdFactor`.

**`grouptransform`** transforms data within each group, returning a same-size result (normalize, fill, center, or custom). **Use `ReplaceValues=false` to keep the original column and append the result as a new variable** — do not overwrite the original when both raw and transformed values are needed:

```matlab
T = grouptransform(T,"Category","zscore","Value");                        % overwrites Value
T = grouptransform(T,"Category","zscore","Value",ReplaceValues=false);    % appends zscore_Value
```

**`pivot`** for cross-tabulation:

```matlab
P = pivot(T, Rows="Category", Columns="Region");                                % counts
P = pivot(T, Rows="Category", Columns="Region", DataVariable="Sales", Method="sum");  % aggregation
```

> Binning rules, `groupfilter`/`grouptransform` use cases, `pivot` options: [grouping-and-aggregation.md](references/grouping-and-aggregation.md)

## Smoothing, Trends, and Patterns

**`smoothdata`** is the unified entry point for smoothing (not `smooth`, which requires Curve Fitting Toolbox):
```matlab
ysmooth = smoothdata(y,"movmean",5);
ysmooth = smoothdata(y,"gaussian",10);
ysmooth = smoothdata(y,"sgolay",11, Degree=3);       % Savitzky-Golay
ysmooth = smoothdata(y,"movmedian",7);               % robust to outliers

% Target specific variables in a table/timetable
T = smoothdata(T,"movmean",5, DataVariables="Value");
```

**Window size formats:** The window can be a scalar or a 2-element vector:
- Scalar `k`: total window length (e.g., `smoothdata(y,"movmean",5)` uses 5 elements total)
- 2-element vector `[kb kf]`: elements before and after the current point (e.g., `smoothdata(y,"movmean",[2 2])` uses 2 before + current + 2 after = 5 elements)

**Pitfall with time-stamped data:** When smoothing a timetable or using `SamplePoints` with datetime or duration values, the window must be a `duration`, not a number. Sort by time first — `SamplePoints` must be ascending:
```matlab
TT = sortrows(TT);
TT = smoothdata(TT,"movmean",days(30), DataVariables="Value");
% WRONG: smoothdata(TT,"movmean",5, ...)  — numeric window errors with time data
```

**Trends:**
```matlab
ydetrend = detrend(y);                                % remove linear trend
ydetrend = detrend(y,2);                              % remove quadratic trend
[LT,ST,R] = trenddecomp(TT.Value);                   % separate trend + seasonality
```

**Pattern detection:**
```matlab
isPeak = islocalmax(y,MinProminence=5);               % local peaks
isValley = islocalmin(y);                             % local valleys
changes = ischange(y,"mean");                         % mean shift points
changes = ischange(y,"linear");                       % slope/trend direction changes
changes = ischange(y,"variance");                     % variance change points
```

## Array and Grid Data

**Use arrays when data is homogeneous numeric AND either (a) naturally 2D/grid (sensors, geospatial), (b) performance-critical inner loop, or (c) upstream tooling delivers arrays. Otherwise, convert to table for metadata and named access.**

### Dimension pitfalls

**`std` and `var` take a weight as the SECOND argument — not a dimension. `movstd` and `movvar` take a weight as the THIRD argument — not a dimension. Always pass weight explicitly before dimension:**

```matlab
std(X,0,2)         % weight=0, dim=2 (per-row std). NOT std(X,2)
var(X,0,2)         % weight=0, dim=2 (per-row var). NOT var(X,2)
movstd(X,k,0,2)   % window=k, weight=0, dim=2. NOT movstd(X,k,2)
movvar(X,k,0,2)   % window=k, weight=0, dim=2. NOT movvar(X,k,2)
```

**Array stats functions do NOT skip NaN automatically.** Pass `"omitnan"` explicitly: `mean(X,1,"omitnan")`, `std(X,0,1,"omitnan")`.

### 2D operations for grids

For 2D grid data (sensor matrices, geospatial fields), use the dedicated 2D functions — do not loop 1D functions over rows/columns:

| Task | 1D (per column) | 2D (grid) |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| Smooth | `smoothdata` | `smoothdata2` |
| Fill missing | `fillmissing` | `fillmissing2` |
| Find peaks | `islocalmax` | `islocalmax2` |
| Find valleys | `islocalmin` | `islocalmin2` |

```matlab
S = smoothdata2(X,"gaussian",{5,5});              % 2D Gaussian smoothing
F = fillmissing2(X,"natural");                    % 2D natural neighbor interpolation
TF = islocalmax2(X,MinProminence=10);             % 2D peak detection
```

### Array-native utilities

**Use `paddata`/`trimdata`/`resize` to align arrays — not manual indexing or NaN concatenation:**
```matlab
B = paddata(X,100);                 % pad to 100 rows
B = trimdata(X,50);                 % trim to 50 rows
B = resize(X,100);                  % pad or trim as needed
```

**Use `mink`/`maxk` for k smallest/largest — not `sort` followed by indexing:**
```matlab
[vals,idx] = mink(X,5);            % 5 smallest per column with indices
[vals,idx] = maxk(X,5);            % 5 largest per column with indices
```

**Use `bounds` for simultaneous min and max:**
```matlab
[lo,hi] = bounds(X);               % min and max per column in one call
```

## Answering Questions About Data

Strategies for producing correct answers when querying tabular data:

- **Top/Bottom N:** Use `topkrows(T,5,"Sales")` — handles missing values automatically (NaN/NaT placed last). Use `sortrows` with `MissingPlacement` only for multi-step workflows where you need the full sorted table afterward. Think about sort direction — "highest rank" means rank #1 (lowest number), "highest salary" means largest number.
- **Cross-variable lookups** ("ages of the top 4 by pregnancies"): sort by the ranking variable, read the answer variable from the first N rows.
- **Missing data:** Watch for sentinel values (0, -999, "N/A") — use `standardizeMissing`. Set `IncludeMissingGroups=false` when NaN groups dominate. Never apply `rmmissing` to an entire table just to answer a question about one variable.
- **Return data as stored.** Don't substitute or map values unless asked.
- **Filtering:** Consider exact (`==`, `matches`) vs partial (`contains`, `startsWith`) matching. Count with `height(filtered)` or `nnz(logicalIdx)`.
