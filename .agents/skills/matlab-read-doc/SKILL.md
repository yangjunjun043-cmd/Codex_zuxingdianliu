# Use MathWorks Documentation

Systematic methodology for reading live MathWorks documentation. Provides a repeatable four-pass strategy (local catalog → `help` → user guide pages → reference pages) that turns documentation lookup into a predictable, efficient operation. Uses MATLAB's `webread` via MCP to fetch pages, with helper scripts that handle URL discovery, HTML parsing, and content extraction.

## When to Use

- You are answering a "How do I..." question related to MathWorks products and workflows
- You guessed a URL and got 404 — use this skill to discover the correct URL from the index
- You need to find which functions exist for a product or workflow — start with the local function catalog
- You need to verify a function's syntax, arguments, or deprecation status from the authoritative source
- You want to check MathWorks best practices for a specific workflow
- Training-data knowledge is uncertain or potentially out of date for a release-specific API
- The user asks what MathWorks recommends for a specific topic
- You want a systematic approach that finds the RIGHT page (not just A page) in minimal tool calls

## When NOT to Use

- The local `help` command is sufficient — prefer `help function_name` for API syntax; it's faster and always correct for the installed version
- The question is about general MATLAB programming patterns, not product-specific workflows
- You already have the authoritative answer from local `help` or a successfully fetched page

## Fast Paths

Not every task needs the full four-pass strategy. Match the task to the shortest path:

| Task                                 | Fast Path                                                                                                                      | Skip                               |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Release notes / what's new           | Fetch `https://www.mathworks.com/help/{product}/release-notes.md` directly via `webread`, then extract the `## R20XXx` section | Steps 0-2 — no script needed       |
| Known standalone function, need ref page | Use a URL from a prior `extract_page_slugs` call, or construct `baseUrl + "ref/{name}.html"` for simple standalone functions | Steps 0-2 — but URL must come from a verified source, not guessed |
| Know the product, need function list | `get_local_function_list(product)`                                                                                             | Steps 1-4 — no web needed          |
| Unfamiliar API, no idea what exists  | Full four-pass strategy                                                                                                        | Nothing — use all steps            |

### Release notes

Release notes are available as clean markdown at `https://www.mathworks.com/help/{product}/release-notes.md`. Fetch this URL with `webread`, then extract the section between `## R20XXx` and the next `## R` header. No HTML parsing needed. Common product slugs: `matlab`, `simulink`, `ecoder`, `rtw`, `stateflow`, `fixedpoint`, `hdlcoder`.

## Help Center Page Hierarchy

- **Product landing page** — Lists top-level categories with short descriptions. Use to discover section slugs.
- **Intermediate category page** — Links to subcategories with one-line descriptions. No leaf content. Drill deeper.
- **Lowest-level category page** — Contains reference groups (functions, blocks, apps) then links to related topics and examples.
- **Topic pages** (`ug/` or product-specific path) — Conceptual or task-based content explaining how to use a feature.
- **Example pages** — Standalone worked examples with supporting files. May include live scripts, data files, or models.
- **Reference pages** (`ref/` or `slref/`) — Function, block, object, or property reference. Multiple subtypes: function ref, object ref, property list, block ref, app ref.
- **Getting started pages** (`gs/`) — Introductory tutorials for new users of a product.
- **Sequential topics** (STEP 1, 2, 3) indicate a workflow with an intended order.

## Choosing What to Fetch

MathWorks doc has two content layers that serve different purposes:

- **Guide pages** (user guide topics, typically under `ug/`) — Show *which* functions to call and in *what order*. Workflow-oriented. Best for learning a new API or deciding an approach. Note: not all products use `ug/` — some (Simulink, Statistics and Machine Learning) use different subdirectory structures. Always discover via the section index.
- **`ref/` pages** (function/object reference) — Show *exactly how* to call each function: full syntax, argument types, name-value pairs, valid enum values, return types, per-argument examples. Best when you know the function but need its exact signature. Some products use product-specific variants (e.g., Simulink uses `slref/`).

**You typically need both.** The `ug/` page tells you the recipe; the `ref/` page tells you the ingredient specifications. Skipping `ref/` means guessing at property names and argument values — which frequently fails because MathWorks APIs use domain-specific names that aren't intuitive (e.g., `"ArxmlFilePackaging"` not `"FilePackaging"`, `"StopTime"` not `"SimulationDuration"`).

### Page value signals (product-independent)

| Signal | Likely high value | Likely low value |
|---|---|---|
| Slug contains `programmatically`, `program-`, or `command-line` | Yes — always programmatic | — |
| Slug contains `property-map-functions` | Yes — API workflow | — |
| Slug contains `explorer`, `interactively`, `using-...editor` | — | Yes — GUI-only |
| Page type is `ref/` with object or function name | Yes — exact signatures | — |
| Page is very large (>30K) with product that has GUI+programmatic paths | — | Suspect GUI — measure before reading |
| Page under ~1500 chars between `Main Content` and footer | — | Likely a navigation stub or redirect |
| Slug starts with `example-` | Mixed — check if it opens with GUI wizard or live-script code |
| `ref/` page listing "-properties" in slug | Yes — property name/value lookup table |

### Four-pass strategy

**Entry rule:** If you have a function name from the user's request or from a `get_local_function_list` call in this session, start at Step 2. Do not skip Step 1 based on training-data knowledge alone — function names change between releases and guessed names waste calls.

1. **Discover functions via the local catalog:** Run `get_local_function_list('product', 'keyword')` to find which functions exist. **Only use this when you don't have a function name yet.**
2. **Get signatures with `help`:** Run `help functionName` or `help namespace`. If `help` answers your question, stop here — don't fetch the web page.
3. **Third pass (`ug/`):** If you need *workflow context* — which functions to call before/after, how they compose, or which of several approaches to take — fetch the `ug/` page with `programmatically` in the slug. This gives you the call sequence and overall pattern.
4. **Fourth pass (`ref/`):** If `help` was insufficient for a specific function (truncated output, missing name-value arguments from recent releases, need the full property enumeration, or need valid categories for a `find` call), fetch its `ref/` page. 

### When `help` is enough (most of the time)

- Syntax and basic arguments for any function
- Block descriptions (`help simulink/Gain`)
- Class and object reference (`help Simulink.SimulationInput`)
- Listing all functions in a namespace (`help matlab.io`) or methods on an object (`methods(obj)`)
- One-line descriptions of what each function does
- Input/output argument types
- Simple usage examples

### When `help` is NOT enough (fetch the web page)

- **Web `ref/` page:** name-value arguments added in recent releases; the full property name enumeration for a settings/properties object; valid enum values for an argument; which category strings are valid for a `find` call; `help` output is truncated or incomplete.
- **Web `ug/` page:** workflow context (what to call before/after); understanding how multiple functions compose together; the task has GUI and programmatic paths and you need to find the programmatic one; decision guides for choosing between approaches.

## URL Patterns

MathWorks documentation URLs follow these patterns. **Do not guess** — use the index to discover slugs.

### Building documentation URLs

All documentation URLs are versioned under `/help/releases/R20XXx/` and default to the installed MATLAB release. URL construction is handled internally by `fetch_product_index` — you do not need to build URLs manually. Get page URLs from one of these verified sources:

1. **`hrefs` output of `fetch_product_index`** — full URLs returned directly, ready to use
2. **`fullUrls` output of `extract_page_slugs`** — full URLs from a section index

`baseUrl` already includes the product path (e.g., `https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2026a/autosar/`). Append only the sub-path: `baseUrl + "ref/name.html"` or `baseUrl + "ug/topic.html"`. Never re-add the product name.

### Page type patterns

| Page type       | Pattern                                     | Example                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product index   | `{base}/{product}/index.html`               | `https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2025b/simulink/index.html`           |
| Section index   | `{base}/{product}/{section-slug}.html`      | `https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2025b/simulink/block-libraries.html` |
| User guide page | `{base}/{product}/ug/{page-slug}.html`      | `https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2025b/simulink/ug/some-topic.html`   |
| Reference page  | `{base}/{product}/ref/{function-name}.html` | `https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2025b/matlab/ref/plot.html`          |

**URL structure varies by product.** Always crawl the section index to discover actual slugs — do not guess subdirectory names.

| Product          | Guide pages                                                        | Reference pages                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `matlab`         | `matlab_prog/slug.html`, `matlab_oop/slug.html` — multiple subdirs | `ref/name.html`                                              |
| `simulink`       | `ug/slug.html`                                                     | `slref/name.html` (also `gui/` for configuration parameters) |
| `systemcomposer` | `ug/slug.html`                                                     | `ref/name.html`                                              |
| `autosar`        | `ug/slug.html`                                                     | `ref/name.html`                                              |
| `stateflow`      | `ug/slug.html`                                                     | `ref/name.html`                                              |

For MATLAB, flat slugs with no subdirectory (e.g. `debug-code.html`) are usually section navigation pages. When crawling a section index, hrefs appear as relative paths — prepend the base URL to construct the full URL.

Common product slugs: `matlab`, `simulink`, `systemcomposer`, `stateflow`, `autosar`, `ecoder`, `fixedpoint`, `stats`, `control`, `signal`, `dsp`, `deeplearning`, `images`, `optim`, `robust`, `mpc`, `sltest`, `parallel-computing`

## Scripts

MATLAB scripts automate the repetitive fetch-and-parse steps. These are **function files** — they require input arguments and must be called via `evaluate_matlab_code`, NOT `run_matlab_file`.

### How to invoke

Use `evaluate_matlab_code` with `project_path` set to this skill's `scripts/` directory (the "Base directory for this skill" shown at the top of this prompt, plus `/scripts`). 
Do NOT use `run_matlab_file` — these are functions that require input arguments.

```
Tool: evaluate_matlab_code
code: "[t, hrefs] = fetch_product_index('simulink', 'Modeling')"
project_path: "<base-directory-for-this-skill>/scripts"
```

### Script reference

| Script                      | Signature                                                         | Purpose                                                                                             |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get_local_function_list.m` | `results = get_local_function_list(product, searchTerm)`          | Read complete categorized function list from local MATLAB install (fastest, works offline)          |
| `fetch_product_index.m`     | `[t, hrefs, baseUrl] = fetch_product_index(product, search, rel)` | Auto-detect release, fetch product index, return section links AND base URL for reuse               |
| `extract_page_slugs.m`      | `[slugs, fullUrls] = extract_page_slugs(sectionUrl)`              | Extract page slugs and full URLs from a section index                                               |
| `fetch_doc_page.m`          | `content = fetch_doc_page(url, maxChars, startChar)`              | Fetch a doc page and extract readable text (default 50K char limit). Pass `startChar` to paginate.  |
| `find_replacement.m`        | `find_replacement(url)`                                           | Search a page for deprecation/replacement language                                                  |
| `DocUtilities.m`            | Static class (not called directly)                                | Shared utilities: HTML stripping, link extraction, URL resolution. Used internally by other scripts |

## Workflow

Use the Fast Paths table above to determine which steps to skip. The full workflow below is for unfamiliar APIs where you don't know what exists.

### Step 1 — Try `help` first (when you have a function name)

If you have a function name from any source, start here:

```matlab
help set_param               % function reference
help Simulink.SimulationInput  % class reference
```

If `help` answers your question, stop here. This is the most common entry point.

### Step 1b — Discover functions via the catalog (when you don't have a name)

If you don't know what function to call, discover what exists:

```matlab
results = get_local_function_list('ecoder');
results = get_local_function_list('simulink', 'code generation');
```

Returns a table with Name, Purpose, and Category. If you don't know the product slug, call `get_local_function_list('unknown')` to list available slugs. Then proceed to Step 1 with the discovered function names.

### Step 2 — Navigate the product index to find the right page

`fetch_product_index` auto-detects the release, constructs the base URL, and returns section links:

```matlab
[t, hrefs, baseUrl] = fetch_product_index('simulink', 'Modeling');
```

The third output `baseUrl` is the resolved version-aware URL — reuse it for all subsequent fetches in this session.

### Step 3 — Fetch a section index to get page slugs

Use a URL from `hrefs` (returned by `fetch_product_index`) directly — do not construct URLs manually:

```matlab
[slugs, fullUrls] = extract_page_slugs(hrefs{2,1});
```

### Step 4 — Fetch and extract a specific page

```matlab
content = fetch_doc_page(fullUrls{3});           % from discovered URLs
```
For very large pages, limit output:
```
content = fetch_doc_page(pageUrl, 10000);        % limit to 10K chars
```

### Step 5 — Verify deprecation notices and replacements
When `help` shows "not recommended", find the recommended replacement on the web page:

```matlab
find_replacement(baseUrl + "ref/hist.html");
```

---

## Instructions

### HTML processing

HTML stripping is handled internally by the fetch scripts (`fetch_doc_page`, `fetch_product_index`, `find_replacement`). Do not reimplement HTML parsing — call the appropriate fetch script instead.

### URL discovery — never guess

- When a URL returns 404, go up one level (section index or product index) and read slugs from the page content.
- **Standalone function** ref page URLs (one dot or none: `plot`, `set_param`) can also be constructed directly: `baseUrl + "ref/{name}.html"` — since `baseUrl` already includes the product path.
- **Functions or objects with a namespace** (e.g., `Simulink.SimulationInput`, `autosar.api.create`): use `extract_page_slugs` on the relevant section index to discover the correct URL.
- All other URLs must be discovered from index pages. The `fetch_product_index` function returns full URLs in `hrefs` — use them directly.

### Variable naming

Avoid names that shadow MATLAB built-ins: `dir`, `input`, `length`, `size`, `path`. If already shadowed in the workspace, use `clear <name>` before calling the built-in.

### Product-specific URL patterns

- **MATLAB**: Has multiple subdirectories (`matlab_prog/`, `matlab_oop/`, `ref/`). Flat slugs with no subdirectory are almost always section navigation pages.
- **Simulink**: Uses `ug/` for guide pages, `slref/` for block/function reference, and `gui/` for configuration parameters.
- **System Composer, Stateflow**: Use `ug/` for guide pages, `ref/` for reference. Straightforward hierarchy.
- **Products with GUI+programmatic paths**: Large character counts don't guarantee programmatic content — GUI-documentation pages can be 20K+ of UI element descriptions. Look for `programmatically` or `program-` in the slug as a reliable signal.


### Release-specific documentation

- All URLs are versioned (`/help/releases/R20XXx/`). `fetch_product_index` defaults to the installed MATLAB release. Pass a release argument (e.g., `"R2024b"`) to target a different version.
- Always verify `help` output first — it's guaranteed to match the installed version.
- If web docs describe features not available in `help`, the user may be on an older release. Note this discrepancy rather than assuming the API exists.
