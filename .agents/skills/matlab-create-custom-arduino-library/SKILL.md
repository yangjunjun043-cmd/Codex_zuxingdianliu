# Create Custom Arduino Library

Help the user interface with Arduino sensors or peripherals from MATLAB by creating
a custom arduino library that bridges MATLAB and Arduino C++ code.

## When to Use

- User wants to read sensors not natively supported (DHT11, DHT22, IMU, air quality)
- User wants to control peripherals not natively supported (OLED displays, motor drivers, NeoPixels)
- User asks "How do I use [sensor/actuator/peripheral] from MATLAB with Arduino?"
- User wants to wrap an existing Arduino C++ library for MATLAB access
- User mentions `LibraryBase`, `arduinoioaddons`, or custom addon creation

## When NOT to Use

- Peripheral is already supported natively (use `listArduinoLibraries` to check)
- User needs to discover or connect to an Arduino board (see `matlab-connect-arduino`)
- User wants generic I2C/SPI communication (built-in)
- User wants to deploy standalone Arduino code (no MATLAB connection)
- User wants Simulink Arduino deployment (different workflow)
- User wants to fix Arduino hardware setup screens

## Workflow

**MANDATORY GATE — do not skip, but keep it fast:**

Before creating a custom addon, you MUST run Steps 0 and 1 below. These are quick
checks (one MATLAB command + one sentence about File Exchange), not deep research.
Report findings in 1-2 lines and move on. If native support or a community addon
exists, stop. Otherwise proceed to Step 2 immediately.

### STEP 0: Check Native Support (ALWAYS DO FIRST)

```matlab
listArduinoLibraries
```

If the peripheral is in the list, tell the user and **STOP**. Do NOT proceed to Step 2
or beyond. Do NOT generate custom library code. Common built-in:
`I2C`, `SPI`, `Serial`, `Servo`, `RotaryEncoder`, `Ultrasonic`, `ShiftRegister`

### STEP 1: Search File Exchange (MathWorks contributions only)

Search for existing add-ons contributed by the MathWorks MATLAB Hardware Team:
- Search: `site:mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange Arduino <peripheral>`
- Look for packages with `+arduinoioaddons` folder structure
- **Only use results authored by MathWorks** — filter by author "MathWorks Hardware Team"
  or "MathWorks". Do NOT recommend community contributions from unknown third parties.

If a MathWorks-contributed add-on is found, guide the user through installation:
1. Download/extract the addon package
2. `addpath` the folder containing `+arduinoioaddons`
3. Install third-party Arduino libraries via `arduinoio.customLibrary.downloadLibrary`
4. Verify with `listArduinoLibraries`

**STOP here if a MathWorks add-on is found — do NOT proceed to Step 2 or beyond.**

### STEP 2: Gather Required Inputs

Before creating a custom library, the user MUST provide:
1. **Custom library name** (e.g., `MyDHT22`)
2. **Third-party Arduino library name** (if wrapping one; e.g., `DHT22`, `U8g2`)
3. **Target output directory** for the MATLAB add-on files

Do NOT proceed to any further steps until all required inputs are provided. If any are
missing, ask the user explicitly and wait for their response.

### STEP 3: Install Third-Party Arduino Library

```matlab
% R2025a+ — use downloadLibrary (preferred)
arduinoio.customLibrary.downloadLibrary("<ArduinoLibraryName>")

% Accepts: library name, name@version, GitHub URL, or local .zip path
% Examples:
arduinoio.customLibrary.downloadLibrary("DHT22")
arduinoio.customLibrary.downloadLibrary("U8g2")
arduinoio.customLibrary.downloadLibrary("https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2")
```

Verify installation:
```matlab
dir(fullfile(arduinoio.CLIRoot, 'user', 'libraries'))
```

**For R2024a-R2024b** (no `downloadLibrary`): manually extract the library zip into
`fullfile(arduinoio.CLIRoot, 'user', 'libraries', '<LibName>')`.

**For pre-R2024a** (no `CLIRoot`): use `arduinoio.IDERoot` instead of `arduinoio.CLIRoot`.

### STEP 4: Scaffold the Add-On

```matlab
% R2025a+ — use createLibraryTemplate (preferred)
arduinoio.customLibrary.createLibraryTemplate("<CustomLibraryName>")
```

This creates the folder structure **in the current working directory (pwd)** and adds the
path automatically. After calling it, the generated files are at:
```
<pwd>/+arduinoioaddons/+<CustomLibraryName>Folder/<CustomLibraryName>.m
<pwd>/+arduinoioaddons/+<CustomLibraryName>Folder/src/<CustomLibraryName>.h
```

Do NOT search other locations — the files are always in pwd.

**Naming:** `createLibraryTemplate("X")` creates `+XFolder/X.m` — it appends "Folder"
to the package name automatically. The generated `setup()` has placeholder comments —
clear the body (no `.begin()` calls). The generated `loop()` is unused and can be deleted.

**For pre-R2025a**: create the folder structure manually:
```
<targetDir>/+arduinoioaddons/+<FolderName>/<ClassName>.m
<targetDir>/+arduinoioaddons/+<FolderName>/src/<HeaderName>.h
```

Then register:
```matlab
addpath('<targetDir>');
savepath;
```

### STEP 5: Configure the MATLAB Class

Update the generated `.m` file. See "MATLAB Class Property Rules" below for exact values.

**Add minimal comments** to the generated `.m` file for user understanding:
- A file-level comment block stating the class purpose and the peripheral it wraps
- Brief comments on non-obvious property values (e.g., why `DependentLibraries` is empty)
- A one-line comment above each public method explaining what it does

### STEP 6: Write the C++ Header

Update the generated `.h` file. See "C++ Header Rules" below and read
`references/cpp-patterns.md` for templates.

**Add minimal comments** to the generated `.h` file for user understanding:
- A file-level comment stating the addon name and peripheral it supports
- A one-line comment above each command ID `#define` explaining the command
- A brief comment in `commandHandler` for each `case` describing what it does

### STEP 7: Verify

```matlab
listArduinoLibraries  % Must show your library name
a = arduino("<port>", "<board>", "Libraries", "<FolderName>/<ClassName>");
obj = addon(a, "<FolderName>/<ClassName>", <args>);
```

## MATLAB Class Property Rules

| Property | Format | Example | Notes |
|----------|--------|---------|-------|
| `LibraryName` | `'FolderName/ClassName'` | `'Adafruit/DHT22'` | Must match namespace |
| `DependentLibraries` | Cell of MATLAB addon names | `{}` or `{'I2C'}` | See decision table below |
| `LibraryHeaderFiles` | `'<ArduinoLibFolder>/<header.h>'` | `'DHT/DHT.h'` | Folder name in CLIRoot + header filename |
| `CppHeaderFile` | `fullfile(arduinoio.FilePath(mfilename('fullpath')), 'src', '<Name>.h')` | — | Always this pattern |
| `CppClassName` | Must match C++ class name | `'DHT22Base'` | Exact match required |

### DependentLibraries Decision Table

| Scenario | Value | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| GPIO-only peripheral (DHT, NeoPixel) | `{}` | No MATLAB bus dependency |
| I2C device using SW_I2C (displays, most sensors) | `{}` | Software I2C bypasses MATLAB's bus |
| I2C device delegating to MATLAB's I2C infrastructure | `{'I2C'}` | MATLAB manages Wire init and pins |
| SPI device | `{}` | MATLAB does not own SPI bus |
| Uses another custom addon | `{'OtherAddon/Name'}` | Chain dependency |

### LibraryHeaderFiles Format

Format: `'<FolderNameInCLIRoot>/<HeaderFilename>'`

```matlab
% GOOD — folder name matches what's in CLIRoot/user/libraries/
LibraryHeaderFiles = {'DHT/DHT.h'}
LibraryHeaderFiles = {'U8g2/U8g2lib.h'}
LibraryHeaderFiles = {'Adafruit_Motor_Shield_V2_Library/Adafruit_MotorShield.h'}

% BAD — just filename without folder
LibraryHeaderFiles = {'DHT.h'}

% BAD — subdirectory path (NEVER include src/ even if the file physically lives there)
LibraryHeaderFiles = {'U8g2/src/U8g2lib.h'}

% BAD — Arduino library name (Wire is not in CLIRoot/user/libraries)
LibraryHeaderFiles = {'Wire/Wire.h'}
```

The Arduino build system automatically searches the `src/` subdirectory within
the library folder, so **NEVER include `src/` in this path**. This is the most
common mistake — even though headers like `U8g2lib.h` physically reside in
`<LibFolder>/src/`, you must write `'U8g2/U8g2lib.h'` NOT `'U8g2/src/U8g2lib.h'`.

## C++ Header Rules

Read `references/cpp-patterns.md` for full templates. Critical rules:

1. **`setup()` MUST NOT initialize hardware** — calling `.begin()`, `Wire.begin()`,
   `SPI.begin()` etc. in setup() causes "Internal error: The initialization of the
   server code is incorrect." Simple variable assignments (e.g., `cursorRow = 0`) are safe.
2. **Use lazy initialization** — init hardware on first command via a dedicated INIT command
3. **`sendResponseMsg` must send >= 1 byte** — `sendResponseMsg(cmdID, 0, 0)` crashes ARM boards (UNO R4, ESP32)
4. **NEVER `#include <Wire.h>` in your addon header** — causes I2C bus conflict with MATLAB.
   Your code must never contain this line. Third-party libraries may include it internally
   (that is fine — you don't control their code), but YOUR .h file must not.
5. **`#include <SPI.h>` is safe** — MATLAB does not own SPI
6. **Use angle brackets** for third-party headers: `#include <U8g2lib.h>`
7. **Use constructor initializer list** for member objects, not in-class initialization

### I2C Bus Conflict — Read `references/bus-conflicts.md`

MATLAB owns the hardware I2C bus (Wire). If your peripheral uses I2C:
- **Preferred:** Use software I2C constructors (e.g., `U8G2_..._SW_I2C`) with `DependentLibraries = {}`
- **Do NOT call `Wire.begin()`** directly
- **Do NOT `#include <Wire.h>`** in your own addon header

If the third-party library requires hardware I2C (e.g., SGP30, motor shields): set
`DependentLibraries = {'I2C'}` and let MATLAB manage the bus. The third-party library
may include Wire.h internally — this is safe because MATLAB has already initialized Wire.
Your C++ code must NOT call `Wire.begin()` since MATLAB already did.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| `DependentLibraries = {'Wire'}` | `Wire` is not in `listArduinoLibraries` | Use `{}` or `{'I2C'}` |
| Third-party lib in `+arduinoioaddons/src/` | Wrong location; build can't find it | `arduinoio.CLIRoot/user/libraries/` |
| `LibraryHeaderFiles = {'U8g2lib.h'}` | Missing folder prefix | `{'U8g2/U8g2lib.h'}` |
| `U8G2_..._HW_I2C` constructor | Conflicts with MATLAB's Wire management | Use `_SW_I2C` constructor |
| `.begin()` calls in `setup()` | Server handshake fails | Init hardware via command; variable assignments are OK |
| `sendResponseMsg(cmdID, 0, 0)` | Crashes ARM boards (nullptr) | Send >= 1 byte always |
| `#include <Wire.h>` in your addon header | Conflicts with MATLAB I2C server | Omit; use SW_I2C or `DependentLibraries = {'I2C'}` |
| Installing via Arduino IDE Library Manager | MATLAB uses its own CLIRoot path | Use `downloadLibrary()` |
| Not calling `addpath` after creating addon | `listArduinoLibraries` won't find it | `addpath` + `savepath` |

## Conventions

- Always check native support first, File Exchange second, create last
- Always use `downloadLibrary` (R2025a+) or manual copy to CLIRoot for third-party libs
- Always verify with `listArduinoLibraries` after registration
- Never call `.begin()` or hardware init in `setup()` — use lazy init via dedicated command
- Always send >= 1 byte in `sendResponseMsg`
- Never include `<Wire.h>` in your own code — use software I2C or depend on `{'I2C'}`
- Never put third-party Arduino libraries inside `+arduinoioaddons`
- Prefer `createLibraryTemplate` (R2025a+) over manual folder creation

## Fallback: When Automated Steps Fail or Take Too Long

If `listArduinoLibraries` hangs, File Exchange search takes too long, `downloadLibrary`
fails, or `createLibraryTemplate` fails — fall back to the pre-R2025a manual approach:

1. **Install library manually:** Download the third-party Arduino library .zip and extract
   it into `fullfile(arduinoio.CLIRoot, 'user', 'libraries', '<LibName>')`.
2. **Create folder structure manually:**
   ```
   <targetDir>/+arduinoioaddons/+<FolderName>/<ClassName>.m
   <targetDir>/+arduinoioaddons/+<FolderName>/src/<HeaderName>.h
   ```
3. **Register manually:** `addpath('<targetDir>'); savepath;`
4. **Continue from Step 5** (configure MATLAB class and C++ header as normal).

Do not retry failing commands repeatedly. Switch to manual creation and proceed.

## Troubleshooting

When errors occur during deployment or usage, read the appropriate reference:

- **Compilation or "source not found" errors** → read `references/common-errors.md`
- **Runtime errors ("unable to receive data", "server code incorrect")** → read `references/common-errors.md`
- **Bus conflicts (I2C/SPI/UART)** → read `references/bus-conflicts.md`
- **C++ code patterns (lazy init, response format, includes)** → read `references/cpp-patterns.md`
