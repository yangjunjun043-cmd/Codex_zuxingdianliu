# Compression and Code Generation Decision Flow

Before applying any compression technique or generating code, ask the user a short
set of questions to choose the right path. Different deployment goals favor
different combinations of pruning, projection, quantization, and code replacement
libraries — there is no single optimal recipe.

Ask each question one at a time. For each option, present the resulting pathway
and what is supported in R2026a so the user can make an informed choice.

---

## Question 1 — Hardware target and Simulink availability

Combine hardware and toolchain into one question because they jointly determine
the available code-replacement libraries.

| Option | Pathway | What's supported (R2026a) |
|---|---|---|
| **ARM Cortex-M with Simulink** | `exportNetworkToSimulink` → `slbuild` with ARM Cortex-M CRL | CMSIS-NN INT8 block replacement: **Conv2D and FC only** (`arm_convolve_wrapper_s8`, `arm_fully_connected_s8`). CMSIS-DSP float32 matrix-multiply replacement (`mw_arm_mat_mult_f32`): FC, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM. **No INT8 CMSIS kernel for LSTM/GRU** — those generate as plain fixed-point C when quantized. |
| **ARM Cortex-M without Simulink** | MATLAB Coder + `coder.DeepLearningConfig('cmsis-nn')` | CMSIS-NN INT8 for Conv2D and FC via MATLAB Coder (no Simulink needed). **No CMSIS-DSP float32 replacement** — LSTM/GRU get generic C only. Use the Simulink path for CMSIS-DSP acceleration on recurrent layers. |
| **ARM Cortex-A** | MATLAB Coder + ARM Compute Library | Conv2D, FC, LSTM, GRU, BiLSTM all supported. Broader layer coverage than Cortex-M. |
| **Generic CPU / no acceleration library** | MATLAB Coder, generic C/C++ | All codegen-compatible layers supported, but no kernel-level acceleration. |
| **x86 (desktop/server)** | MATLAB Coder + `coder.DeepLearningConfig('mkldnn')` | Intel MKL-DNN/oneDNN acceleration for all major DL layers. Compression less critical — targets typically have ample memory. |
| **GPU (NVIDIA)** | MATLAB Coder + `coder.DeepLearningConfig('cudnn')` or `'tensorrt'` | cuDNN or TensorRT acceleration. Compression rarely needed for GPU targets; use TensorRT's built-in optimizations instead. |
| **FPGA / NPU** | Out of scope for this skill | Refer to Deep Learning HDL Toolbox or vendor-specific tools. |

Auto-detect when possible: if Simulink is not on the toolbox list from
`detect_matlab_toolboxes`, present only the Cortex-M-without-Simulink option.

## Question 2 — Primary deployment goal

| Option | Recommended techniques | Caveats |
|---|---|---|
| **Reduce flash / ROM footprint** | Pruning + projection + quantization (combined) | Both pruning and projection require retraining (pruning calls `trainnet` between iterations; projection needs fine-tuning after). Combined savings are model-dependent; ~77% has been reported on representative CNN+FC examples — see the combined pipeline in `compression.md`. |
| **Reduce SRAM / runtime memory** | Pruning + quantization (skip projection) | Projection does not reduce activation memory. |
| **Lowest latency on target** | Hardware-dependent. **Cortex-M + CNN/FC**: INT8 + CMSIS-NN. **Cortex-M + LSTM/GRU**: float32 + CMSIS-DSP. **Also worth trying:** structural compression (pruning, projection) — fewer MACs typically means lower latency, and on MCU targets the structural savings can dominate kernel-replacement gains. | Quantizing an LSTM for Cortex-M shrinks flash but does **not** speed up inference — there is no INT8 CMSIS kernel for recurrent layers. |
| **Pure integer arithmetic required** (no FPU, MISRA-int) | Quantization is mandatory | LSTM + integer-only on Cortex-M generates plain fixed-point code; expect slower runtime than the float32+CMSIS-DSP path. |
| **Maximize accuracy** | Try compression with accuracy gating before falling back to the float32 baseline. `compressNetworkUsingTaylorPruning` exposes a `ValidationThreshold` NVP that stops the pruning loop as soon as the validation metric drops below the threshold; quantization with proper calibration often preserves accuracy on overparameterized models. | Whether compression preserves accuracy is model-dependent — measure on a held-out set before committing. Skip compression entirely only when the accuracy budget is tighter than the size budget. |

---

## Question 3 — Retraining tolerance

Skip this question when the agent already knows the dataset is unavailable
(MATLAB-trained workflows: training data is in scope; external model import
workflows: already covered in Project Discovery).

| Option | Available techniques | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| **Yes — full retraining** | Pruning, projection, quantization | Pruning and projection both call `trainnet` after compression. |
| **Limited — light fine-tuning only** | Projection (conservative goal) + quantization | Projection typically recovers accuracy with a few epochs; pruning typically needs more. Choose the goal empirically — sweep a few values of `LearnablesReductionGoal`, or use the default `ExplainedVarianceGoal=0.95`. |
| **No — post-training only** | Quantization (calibration, no training). Also worth a trade-off pass: projection on the calibration data, with no fine-tuning afterward. | Pruning is off the table without retraining. Projection without fine-tuning is not the documented happy path, but on overparameterized models — including most networks shown in MathWorks doc examples — modest projection often holds accuracy within a small margin. For a single goal, call `compressNetworkUsingProjection(net, calibData)` directly (it runs PCA internally) using either the default (driven by `ExplainedVarianceGoal=0.95`) or a single `LearnablesReductionGoal` value. For a sweep across multiple goals, precompute `neuronPCA` once and reuse it. Skip the `trainnet` step and measure accuracy on a held-out set. Keep the most aggressive goal whose accuracy delta stays within budget. |

## Optional follow-up — PIL hardware available?

Ask only if the user picked Cortex-M and has chosen quantization. Use this to
decide whether to offer a side-by-side library-free vs CMSIS comparison.

| Option | Agent's offer |
|---|---|
| **Yes — dev board on hand** | Generate both CMSIS and library-free versions; PIL on the target; compare latency and code size. |
| **No** | Default to CMSIS path. Library-free comparison without hardware would only show static code-size delta — published CMSIS-NN INT8 speedup is well established for Conv2D/FC, so on host alone there is no fair latency comparison. |

If the network is LSTM-heavy on Cortex-M with quantization chosen, flag the
specific tradeoff: CMSIS-NN provides no LSTM acceleration in the quantized path,
so library-free may be competitive there. PIL-only conclusion.

## Recipe matrix

After collecting answers, recommend one recipe and confirm before running. The
recipe should always be presented as a recommendation the user can override.

| Hardware | Goal | Retrain? | LSTM in net? | Recommended path |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cortex-M + Simulink | Flash | Yes | Yes | Project (LSTM+FC) → quantize → `exportNetworkToSimulink(qNet)` → `slbuild` with ARM Cortex-M CRL |
| Cortex-M + Simulink | Flash | No | Yes | Quantize → `exportNetworkToSimulink(qNet)` → `slbuild` (FC INT8 via CMSIS-NN, LSTM as plain fixed-point) |
| Cortex-M + Simulink | Latency | Any | Yes | **Skip quantization** for LSTM → float32 export → `slbuild` (LSTM gets `mw_arm_mat_mult_f32`) |
| Cortex-M + Simulink | Latency | Yes | No (CNN/FC only) | Quantize → export → `slbuild` (CMSIS-NN INT8, ~2.8x speedup) |
| Cortex-M + Simulink | Integer-only | Any | Any | Quantize → export → `slbuild` (FC INT8, LSTM fixed-point) |
| Cortex-M + Simulink | Max accuracy | Any | Any | Try pruning with `ValidationThreshold` and/or post-training quantization with held-out validation; fall back to float32 export only if accuracy degrades beyond budget |
| Cortex-M, no Simulink (CNN/FC) | Flash or latency | Any | No | Calibrate → `codegen` with `coder.DeepLearningConfig('cmsis-nn')` (INT8 CMSIS-NN for Conv2D/FC) |
| Cortex-M, no Simulink (LSTM/GRU) | Any goal | Any | No | Generic C `codegen` only — no CMSIS-DSP without Simulink. Use Simulink path for LSTM/GRU acceleration. |
| Cortex-A | Flash | Yes | Any | Project → quantize → MATLAB Coder + ARM Compute Library |
| Generic CPU | Flash | Yes | Any | Project → quantize → MATLAB Coder |

## Caveats the agent should always state

- **CMSIS-NN does not provide INT8 kernels for LSTM, GRU, or BiLSTM in R2026a.**
  Quantizing a recurrent layer for Cortex-M reduces flash but generates plain
  fixed-point C, not an accelerated kernel. The float32 path with CMSIS-DSP
  matrix-multiply replacement (`mw_arm_mat_mult_f32`) is the documented
  acceleration for recurrent layers.
- **Pruning and projection require retraining**, so both are unavailable to
  users who answered "No" to retraining.
- **`exportNetworkToSimulink` accepts projected networks directly in R2026a.**
  Calling `unpackProjectedLayers` before export is no longer required.
- **For the direct MATLAB Coder path**, `lstmProjectedLayer` and
  `gruProjectedLayer` are supported by `coder.loadDeepLearningNetwork` for
  generic C/C++ codegen. A `ProjectedLayer` wrapper is codegen-compatible
  only when its contents are stateless (conv/FC, or LSTM/GRU in
  stateful-I/O mode); a wrapped stateful LSTM/GRU is not. When in doubt,
  call `unpackProjectedLayers` first — that always produces a
  codegen-compatible form.
- **Try multiple paths and compare** when retraining is acceptable. For an
  LSTM-heavy flash-bound model, generate both project+quantize and quantize-only
  variants, measure flash and MAE, and let the user choose.
