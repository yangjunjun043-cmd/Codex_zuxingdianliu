# Pruning (Structured Weight Removal)

Pruning removes the least important convolutional filters to reduce model size and
computation. Use `compressNetworkUsingTaylorPruning` — it handles the full iterative
workflow (score calculation, filter removal, fine-tuning) in a single call.

```matlab
% Define fine-tuning options for the pruning loop
options = trainingOptions("adam", ...
    MaxEpochs=10, ...
    MiniBatchSize=32, ...
    InitialLearnRate=1e-4, ...
    Verbose=false);

% Prune: remove 30% of learnable parameters
[prunedNet, info] = compressNetworkUsingTaylorPruning(net, XTrain, YTrain, ...
    "crossentropy", options, ...
    LearnablesReductionGoal=0.3, ...
    LearnablesReductionIncrement=0.05, ...
    Plots="pruning-progress");

% Inspect results
fprintf("Achieved reduction: %.1f%%\n", info.LearnablesReduction * 100);
fprintf("Pruned layers: %s\n", strjoin(info.PrunedLayerNames, ", "));
fprintf("Stop reason: %s\n", info.StopReason);
```

For the full list of name-value arguments, defaults, and behavior, consult the
function's help (`help compressNetworkUsingTaylorPruning`) or the
[reference page](https://www.mathworks.com/help/deeplearning/ref/compressnetworkusingtaylorpruning.html)
rather than relying on a list in this file. Two name-value arguments that are
worth flagging because they affect the recipe:

- `LearnablesReductionGoal` — target proportion of parameters to remove. Drives
  the trade-off between flash savings and accuracy.
- `ValidationThreshold` — stops the iterative pruning loop when the validation
  metric at the end of a fine-tuning cycle drops below the threshold. Use this
  when accuracy is the primary constraint (see the "Maximize accuracy" recipe in [`compression-decision.md`](compression-decision.md)).

**Notes:**
- Requires the Deep Learning Toolbox Model Compression Library (support package). If
  `which compressNetworkUsingTaylorPruning` returns "not found" on a system
  with the support package installed, the SPKG is on a stale build — ask the
  user to update the support package via Add-On Explorer.
- **Which API to use:**
  - `compressNetworkUsingTaylorPruning` — use when the network can be trained
    with `trainnet` (single-network training, including custom loss functions).
    Output is a standard `dlnetwork` — no conversion step needed. The function
    iteratively scores filters, removes lowest-scoring, and fine-tunes.
  - `taylorPrunableNetwork` / `updateScore` / `updatePrunables` — use when
    training requires a custom training loop (e.g., GANs, multi-network
    encoder-decoder setups). Output is a `taylorPrunableNetwork` object.
- Operates on convolutional layers only; for FC/LSTM/GRU reduction (or for additional conv-layer reduction), use projection
