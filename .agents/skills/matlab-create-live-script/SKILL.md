# Live Scripts

Plain-text `.m` files that render as rich documents in the MATLAB Live Editor. Version-control friendly — never use binary `.mlx`.

## When to Use

- Tutorials, reports, analysis notebooks, or documentation
- Interactive exploration with inline figures and equations
- Version-controlled content (plain-text `.m`, not binary `.mlx`)
- Converting an existing binary `.mlx` file to plain-text `.m`

## When NOT to Use

- Regular scripts without rich formatting
- Function files
- MATLAB older than R2025a

## Converting from `.mlx`

To convert a binary `.mlx` file to a plain-text `.m` live script, run the following at the MATLAB Command Window. The recipe is **not** part of the resulting `.m` file:

```matlab
editor = matlab.desktop.editor.openDocument(mlxPath, Visible=0);
editor.saveAs(newMPath);  % use .m extension
editor.closeNoPrompt;
```

## Rules

- Text lines use `%[text]` — NOT bare `%`
- One paragraph = one `%[text]` line — do not hard-wrap; let the Live Editor handle line width
- No empty `%[text]` lines — they render as unwanted blank space
- Section headers: `%%` on its own line, then `%[text] ## Title` on next line
- No blank lines in the file, except a single blank line directly before `%[appendix]`
- No `figure` command — implicit figure creation only
- No more than one plot per section (unless using tiled layouts)
- No `close all` or `clear`
- No `mfilename` — does not work as intended in live scripts. Hardcode filenames or use `pwd`.
- Escape these characters when used as **literal text** (not as markdown syntax): `*`, `_`, `[`, `]`, `` ` ``, `\`. Also escape `.` after a digit and `#` at line start.
- Equations use single-`$` inline form only: `$ a = \\pi r^2 $` (no `$$ ... $$`). For a centered/display equation, wrap the line: `%[text]{"align":"center"} $ X(k) = \\sum\_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2\\pi kn/N} $`
- Inside an equation, LaTeX commands take double backslashes (`\\sin`, `\\frac`, `\\pi`) and markdown characters take single (`\_`, `\*`). Use a tool that takes literal text (Edit, Write, fwrite) — **don't** use Bash heredocs; they collapse `\\` to `\` even when quoted, which corrupts LaTeX equations.
- Last list item (bulleted or numbered) ends with `\`
- Every file ends with the required appendix
- Avoid `fprintf` — drop the semicolon or use `disp()`. Output appears inline below the code that produced it, not in the Command Window.
- Outputs should serve the reader's understanding, not verify execution

## Required Appendix

Every live script must end with:

```matlab
%[appendix]{"version":"1.0"}
%---
%[metadata:view]
%   data: {"layout":"inline"}
%---
```

## Reading live scripts (Token Optimization)

When reading a live script file, ignore everything below the `%[appendix]` marker. The appendix contains embedded images and metadata that consume tokens without adding useful information. All code and text content appears before it.

## Format Reference

| Syntax | Renders as |
|--------|-----------|
| `%%` | Section break |
| `%[text] # Title` | H1 heading |
| `%[text] ## Section` | H2 heading |
| `%[text] **bold**` | **Bold** |
| `%[text] *italic*` | *Italic* |
| `` %[text] `code` `` | `Monospace` |
| `%[text] <u>text</u>` | Underlined text |
| `%[text] $ a = \\pi r^2 $` | Inline equation |
| `%[text]{"align":"center"} $ ... $` | Centered/display equation |
| `%[text] - item` | Bullet |
| `%[text] - last \` | Last bullet |
| `%[text] 1. item` | Numbered list |
| `%[text] 2. last \` | Last numbered item |
| `%[text] [text](url)` | External hyperlink |
| `%[text] [text](internal:id)` | Internal link to an anchor |
| `%[text] %[text:anchor:id] ...` | Anchor (link target) |
| `%[text:tableOfContents]{"heading":"..."}` | Table of Contents |

**IDs (anchors, and any other id-bearing element):** letters, digits, and underscores only. No hyphens — `my-section` won't bind; use `my_section`. For anchors, place the marker immediately after `%[text]` at the start of the line.

### Tables

```matlab
%[text:table]
%[text] | Method | Result |
%[text] | --- | --- |
%[text] | Trapezoidal | 1.9998 |
%[text:table]
```

## Example

```matlab
%[text] # Sinusoidal Signals
%[text] Examples of sinusoidal signals in MATLAB.
%[text:tableOfContents]{"heading":"Contents"}
%[text] - sine waves
%[text] - cosine waves \
x = linspace(0,8*pi);
%%
%[text] ## Sine Wave
plot(x,sin(x))
title('Sine Wave')
xlabel('x (radians)')
ylabel('sin(x)')
grid on
%%
%[text] ## Cosine Wave
plot(x,cos(x))
title('Cosine Wave')
xlabel('x (radians)')
ylabel('cos(x)')
grid on
%%
%[text] ## Summary
%[text] The sine and cosine functions are $ \\pi/2 $ radians out of phase.

%[appendix]{"version":"1.0"}
%---
%[metadata:view]
%   data: {"layout":"inline"}
%---
```

## Common Patterns

### Mathematical Explanations with Equations

```matlab
%[text] ## Theory
%[text] The discrete Fourier transform is defined as:
%[text]{"align":"center"} $ X(k) = \\sum\_{n=0}^{N-1} x(n) e^{-j2\\pi kn/N} $
%[text] where $ x(n) $ are the time-domain samples and $ k $ indexes the frequency bins.
```

### Code with Inline Comments

```matlab
%%
%[text] ## Data Processing
%[text] Load and filter the data, then visualize the results.
data = load('measurements.mat');
filtered = lowpass(data, 0.5);  % Apply lowpass filter
plot(filtered)
title('Filtered Data')
```

### Tiled Layouts for Comparison

Use only when side-by-side comparison is important to the illustration:

```matlab
%%
%[text] ## Comparison of Methods
tiledlayout(1,2)
nexttile
plot(method1)
title('Method 1')
nexttile
plot(method2)
title('Method 2')
```

## Workflow

1. **Plan** — Title, setup, analysis sections, summary
2. **Write** — `%[text]` for text, `%%` for sections, appendix at end. Use a tool that takes literal text (Edit, Write, fwrite). **Don't** use Bash heredocs (`cat > file <<EOF`); they collapse `\\` to `\` even when quoted, which corrupts LaTeX equations.
3. **Validate** *(if MATLAB attached)* — Run the code through `evaluate_matlab_code` to confirm it executes cleanly. Note the wall-clock time — Embed Outputs takes about the same.
4. **Embed Outputs** *(optional, if MATLAB attached)* — Run `executeLiveScript("<absolute-path>.m")` to save each section's outputs (plots, displayed values) inline next to the code that produced them.
5. **Verify Rendering** *(optional, if MATLAB attached)* — Run `export("<absolute-path>.m", "<absolute-path>.html")` to produce an HTML approximation of the rendered document. Read it back to confirm equations are typeset, figures appear inline, `%[text]` directives don't leak as literal text, etc. Delete the `.html` when done — it's a verification artifact, not a deliverable.

The Write step is the load-bearing one — Write alone produces a valid live script the user can open and run. Validate, Embed Outputs, and Verify Rendering are progressive enhancements that require an attached MATLAB session. Without one, stop after Write. After Embed Outputs, the file is rewritten to disk by MATLAB — re-read before any further edits.

## `executeLiveScript`

Bundled in the `scripts/` folder of this skill. Add to path before first use:

```matlab
addpath(fullfile(skillRoot, "scripts"));   % skillRoot = directory containing this SKILL.md
```

Calling `executeLiveScript(filePath)` returns nothing on success. Runtime errors inside the script do not raise exceptions — the script writes them into the appendix as `"dataType":"error"` blocks; grep the saved `.m` to find them.

**Run Validate before Embed Outputs.** If a cell errors during Embed Outputs, that cell becomes an error block and outputs in cells *after* it are stripped from the file. Run through `evaluate_matlab_code` first.

**If Embed Outputs errors with "Nested Live Editor execution" or hangs past the Validate time:** retry once with the MATLAB desktop visible. If that also fails, the on-disk file from Write is still valid — skip Embed Outputs and let the user run the script themselves.

## Checklist

Before finishing a live script, verify:
- [ ] File has .m extension
- [ ] Sections use `%%` alone on its own line, followed by `%[text] ##`

- [ ] One plot per section (unless tiled layout)
- [ ] Bulleted and numbered lists end with backslash on last item
- [ ] LaTeX command backslashes are doubled in the saved file: `\\sin`, `\\frac`, `\\pi`
- [ ] No `figure` commands
- [ ] No `close all` or `clear` at start
- [ ] No `mfilename`

- [ ] Outputs serve the reader, not the developer

## Not Yet Supported

Minor features planned for a future revision:

- Interactive controls (sliders, dropdowns, numeric inputs)
- Hide Code View (output view that hides the source code)
